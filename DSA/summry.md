# Questions & Answers
- **Q: What is the main goal of this course?**
    - The main goal is to make participants comfortable with algorithm basics, including performance and efficiency evaluation.
- **Q: What is the difference between linear search and binary search algorithms?**
    - Linear search checks every element sequentially, while binary search uses divide and conquer to halve the search space.
- **Q: How does the runtime of an algorithm affect its efficiency?**
    - Runtime, or time complexity, measures how long an algorithm takes as input size increases. Lower time complexity indicates higher efficiency.
- **Q: What are the advantages of using binary search over linear search?**
    - Binary search is more efficient, especially for larger inputs, as it finds the target in fewer steps by eliminating half the search space with each comparison.
